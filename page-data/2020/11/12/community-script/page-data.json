GREENDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDY ROOM - DAY.</strong></div>\r\n<div class = \"action\">The morning after a halloween dance at Greendale, the study group is sitting around the study room table, except for Troy and Abed, who are just walking in together. They are mid-conversation.</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> ABED </p> \r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nI still don't understand why that group of people was dressed up as Thing 1, Thing 2, Thing 3, and Thing 4. There were only 1 and 2 in the book.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> TROY </p> \r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nI know! If you're gonna just make up your costume you really aren't dressing up as anything.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<div class = \"action\">Troy and Abed take their seats at the table.</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> BRITTA </p> \r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nHalloween is a lot more than a costume contest. It's a celebration of culture, a chance for people to escape from their daily lives. You guys should keep that in mind before you go around RuPauling other peoples outfits.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<div class = \"action\">Silence for a beat.</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> SHIRLEY </p> \r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nSorry I couldn't make it to the dance last night...\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<div class = \"action\">The group mumbles false assurances to Shirley.</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> SHIRLEY (CONT'D) </p> \r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nYou guys realized I was missing right?\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> PIERCE </p> \r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nDon't worry, I noticed.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> JEFF </p> \r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nThe only thing you missed from last night was drunk Britta.\r\n<br>\r\n(to Britta)\r\n<br>\r\nWatching you dance is more awkward than watching an air guitar solo at Karaoke.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<div class = \"action\">The PA system sounds on.

It turns out someone preformed a mis-dean-meanor at the dance last night. The culprit was caught going around with a needle and discretely pricking people.
