This script is an imagination of the conversation that would have taken place the day after Parasite historically swept the Oscars.</p>\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"script-content\">\r\n<div class = \"action\">  <strong>MONDAY MORNING. THE GREENDALE SEVEN SITS AROUND THE STUDY ROOM TABLE.</strong> </div>\n<p class = \"character\"> ANNIE </p>  \r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\"> Good morning! How was everyone's weekend? </p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> ABED  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nI watched The Passion of the Christ. Wasn't a very faithful adaptation of the book.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class= \"character\"> TROY  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nI went to a duck pond to feed the ducks... but I ate all the bread before I got there.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> SHIRLEY  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nDid anyone else watch Parasite win four Oscars? Big night for Korea.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<div class = \"action\">  Shrugs and silence across the group. </div>\n<p class = \"character\"> SHIRLEY (CONT'D)  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nNobody watched it or nobody's happy for Korea?\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> JEFF  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nShirley, we don't all have enough time to watch four hours of Hollywood jerking itself off. But of course we are happy for <strong>South</strong> Korea.</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> PIERCE  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nSpeak for yourself Jeffrey.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<div class = \"action\">  Everyone glares at Pierce, except Troy. </div>\n<p class = \"character\"> TROY  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nIn Pierce's defense, the Oscars viewership has been dropping recently. Maybe it was time to spice it up.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> BRITTA  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nTroy... Pierce was referring to South Korea.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> TROY  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nOh... me too...\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> SHIRLEY  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nWhat about you Abed? Surely you watched the Oscars.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> ABED  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nI'm with Jeff on this one. I don't think their target audience is people who know anything about film. It's more so middle-age divorcees.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<div class = \"action\">  Shirley is visibly upset. Britta feels bad. </div>\n<p class = \"character\"> BRITTA  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nThat's not true Abed. I know plenty of people that watched it.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> JEFF  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nDo you know anyone that doesn't go to Greendale?\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> BRITTA  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nShaa... my parents...\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<div class = \"action\">  Shirley gets more upset. </div>\n<p class = \"character\"> JEFF  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nOkay, at the end of the day, Shirley is allowed to like what she wants. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. I record reruns of Wipe-out, Troy might have a masturbation fixation, and Shirley enjoys the Academy Awards.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> TROY  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nWait... the Oscars and the Academy Awards are the same thing?\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> PIERCE  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nOf course they are dummy. The Academy Awards get rebroadcast as the Oscars for the Mexican audience.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<p class = \"character\"> TROY  </p>\r\n<div class=\"dialogue-block\">\r\n<p class = \"dialogue\">\r\nOh no. Does that mean the Tony's were last night as well? I promised an Italian chick I'd watch it with her.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\n<div class = \"action\">  Opening sequence. </div>\r\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Writing a Scene for Community","publishDate":"2020-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/b888777a80aa9f5f8e5b143568f73ed9/01f8d/community_logo.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b888777a80aa9f5f8e5b143568f73ed9/f836f/community_logo.jpg 200w,\n/static/b888777a80aa9f5f8e5b143568f73ed9/01f8d/community_logo.jpg 375w","sizes":"(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px"}}}},"fields":{"date":"2020-06-28","slug":"2020/06/28/community-script/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2020/06/28/community-script/","date":"2020-06-28"}},
