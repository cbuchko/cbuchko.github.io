Over-eager aggression or cautious coat-tailing. The fascinating nuance of Survivor is this tightrope balance. If you play too hard, you get sniped. If you play too slow, you won’t win. This “threat level management” is maybe the most important aspect of Survivor.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">The surface level strategy for managing your threat level is staying under the radar. If you lay low, there’s no reason to vote you out. We’ve seen this work masterfully in the past. Most recently, Gabler stayed submerged and underestimated very intentionally. The problem is this strategy works for only exactly one person every season. If six people are “managing their threat levels”, five people are just playing invisible games.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">Overall, I think this philosophy leads to a misconception that you shouldn’t play Survivor <strong>at all</strong>. Don’t run votes, don’t search for advantages, don’t make too many friends. New era Survivor has a lot of players that did this. The game will leave you behind. Especially in the early game, when you're in a nebulous vacuum where anyone can be the first boot. This is the exact time to hit the gas, but not in the way you might expect.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">My argument is that you should absolutely play pre-merge Survivor as hard as possible. But not strategically. Early game Survivor calls for aggressive social play. Every moment is an opportunity to bond with a potential ally, weasel out some information, or to just get people to like you more. The most proven method to avoid getting voted out? Have people like you so much they want you to stay.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">In the pre-merge, it’s not about putting a name on the chopping block, it’s about keeping your name off of it. Getting allies isn’t about building numbers for votes, it’s about locking down people who won’t vote for you. Players are so concerned about eliminating people on day 3 because they don’t want them there on day 26. Slow down. Breathe. Once you’re merged you can get those strategic gears turning, but for now, just vibe.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">A great example is Kenzie. Kenzie was socially working everybody from day one. It’s insane how Yanu was so obsessed with tribe strength and Kenzie was never perceived as weak. And then post merge nobody considered her a threat at all, which is also absurd. Contrast Kenzie with Q, someone who was hellbent on making every strategic decision, and it’s easy to see which playstyle is more fruitful.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">The biggest argument against this strategy is that being a social butterfly puts a huge target on your back. It’s true, if everyone loves you, you are a jury threat. Someone like Kaleb in 45 is the golden example, too likable for his own good. Kaleb missplayed though. His mistake is that he rizzed everyone. He rizzed Belo, he rizzed Reba. People saw he was fence sitting, and that’s why he got targeted.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">The Aggressive Social Game strategy is a pre-merge strategy. This gameplay should be used to secure your position within your tribe. Cement yourself as a cornerstone, gear up for the merge, and use that social capital to start a strategic onslaught. My other Survivor Meta Game blog post delves into why this sets you up for an easy win.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Winning New Era Survivor: Social Aggression","publishDate":"2024-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5037593984962405,"src":"/static/ac6748b28abc18110ea757bb448c006a/14b42/snuff.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ac6748b28abc18110ea757bb448c006a/f836f/snuff.jpg 200w,\n/static/ac6748b28abc18110ea757bb448c006a/2244e/snuff.jpg 400w,\n/static/ac6748b28abc18110ea757bb448c006a/14b42/snuff.jpg 800w,\n/static/ac6748b28abc18110ea757bb448c006a/a6352/snuff.jpg 960w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}},"fields":{"date":"2024-06-14","slug":"2024/06/14/survivor-social-aggression/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2024/06/14/survivor-social-aggression/","date":"2024-06-14"}},
