And thank god, the 90-minutes are sticking around. This cast looks chaotic and messy. Some personalities that I'm just dying to see play. I can't wait.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">BTW I ran out of time on this one, procrastinated too much before the premiere. Sorry it's a little rushed and there's no pictures. Still gonna get the prediction right again.</p>\n<h2 class=\"text-xl\">Zero Chancers</h2>\n<p class=\"text-base\">Bhanu jumps out to me as the most obvious trainwreck player ever. He's just so over the top, and not really in a personable way. He's gonna have a hard time fitting in, and that's all it takes to be the first boot.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">I'm generally too harsh on young players, and I don't want to fall into that fallacy, but Jelinksy is not it. I'm very confident that Jelinsky is out of his depth playing this game, and I don't see how he could make any impact. At best he's a Sami type player.</p>\n<h2 class=\"text-xl\">Long Shots</h2>\n<p class=\"text-base\">Survivor is a social game. Especially in the new era, if you aren't a social player, you 100% won't win. In this category I've thrown a lot of people who don't emphasize their social game. Venus, Tim, Soda and Jem all stand out to me as people that may excel at other aspects of Survivor, but they don't have that seductive personality to make their alliance members obsessed with them.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">I also have Ben and Kenzie in here. Because while I am extremely excited to watch both of them play, they both have too much main character energy to win Survivor. Kenzie especially is just not gonna fly under the radar, she goes mid-merge easily. Ben is amazing, and is my current favourite, but he won't win.</p>\n<h2 class=\"text-xl\">Dark Horses</h2>\n<p class=\"text-base\">Randen comes across as very cold and fatherly at first glance. His personality is pretty subdued for Survivor. But in his interviews he stresses the importance of the social game. He knows he needs to make relationships. I think someone with his determination and work ethic could definitely win Survivor. His biggest downfall is if he ends up being like \"Uncle\" Bruce.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">I just love Jess. Jess is so fun. I want her to win. This pick is totally just a \"I have a good feeling\" pick. I hope she fits in</p>\n<h2 class=\"text-xl\">Winner Contenders</h2>\n<p class=\"text-base\">I had a hard time picking the winner this season. The personalities on this season are so wild</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">I originally wanted to put Charlie lower based on first impressions. But the more I listened to him, the more I loved his perspective. Charlie comes across as humble, self-aware and extremely likable. He's someone that easily makes the merge, and with the right alliance Charlie could walk his way to the end.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">Hunter is my quintessential pick where I can acknowledge he has all the ingredients, I just don't think it'll come together for him. Definitely a potential fan favourite, and definitely a potential jury threat, but he'll need to play super hard to win.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">Tevin is a lot of fun and very personable. In the new era, I can see a player like Tevin doing really well. People will fall in love with him, be dying to work with him, and he's clever. Tevin will need to find a balance between Yam Yam and Dee, because if he goes full Yam Yam I think he gets sniped.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">I originally had Q in my No Chance category. Honestly his vibe is not what I normally predict as a winner. BUT, in his interviews Q is so incredibly funny, well-spoken and charismatic. He has 10/10 charisma but it's not obvious like a Kaleb or a Tevin. And he's figured out the new era meta-game. In one question he says he wants to solidify an alliance early and then hold on tight until the endgame. If he manages that, he'll win.</p>\n<p class=\"text-base\">Here is my final ranking:</p>\n<h4>Winner Picks</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Q</li>\n<li>Tevin</li>\n<li>Hunter</li>\n<li>Charlie</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Dark Horses</h4>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Jess</li>\n<li>Randen</li>\n<li>Tiffany</li>\n<li>Morriah</li>\n<li>Maria</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Long Shots</h4>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>Tim</li>\n<li>Kenzie</li>\n<li>Venus</li>\n<li>Ben</li>\n<li>Soda</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>No Chance</h4>\n<ol start=\"15\">\n<li>Liz</li>\n<li>Jem</li>\n<li>Jelinsky</li>\n<li>Bhanu</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"Survivor 46 First Impressions and Predictions","publishDate":"2024-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5873015873015872,"src":"/static/837c5acb1709efdeb242e404761312b8/c983f/Survivor_46.png","srcSet":"/static/837c5acb1709efdeb242e404761312b8/69585/Survivor_46.png 200w,\n/static/837c5acb1709efdeb242e404761312b8/c983f/Survivor_46.png 397w","sizes":"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px"}}}},"fields":{"date":"2024-02-28","slug":"2024/02/28/survivor-46-predictions/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2024/02/28/survivor-46-predictions/","date":"2024-02-28"}},
