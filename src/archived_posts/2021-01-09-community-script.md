My first fan-made Community script in 2021 is inspired by real events.

<br>

<div class="script-content">
<div class = "action"><strong>INT. STUDY ROOM - MORNING</strong></div>
<div class = "action">The study group walks into the study room together. Centered on the table is a traffic stoplight with its green light on. The group is confused.</div>

<p class = "character"> JEFF </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Annie, are you about to give another one of your PSA's on the dangers of designated driving?
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
No.. but is it so bad to point out that driving a car filled with drunks could be distracting?
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Compared to being drunk yourself?
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Compared to calling a cab! Pay a little extra money and leave the risk to the professional!
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> ABED </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
How much extra money do I need to change the subject?
</p>
</div>

<div class = "action"> As he speaks, Abed walks over to the traffic light and starts examining it. The light changes from green to yellow.</div>
<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Careful Abed, I don't think it likes that.
</p>
</div>

<div class = "action">Abed backs away slowly but the light stays yellow. Everyone takes their seats at the table.</div>
<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
How are we supposed to study with this thing in the way?
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character">  JEFF </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Don't worry about that.
</p>
</div>

<div class = "action"> Jeff picks up the traffic light and begins to walk away. The group yells at him to be careful and to put it back. The light turns from yellow to red and an alarm blares.</div>

<p class = "character">  ABED </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Something really awesome or really terrible is about to happen.
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character">  TROY </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Like Heath Ledger's Joker or Jared Leto's Joker.
</p>
</div>

<div class = "action"> The Dean walks into the room. Abed is disappointed.</div>

<p class = "character"> ABED  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Nicholson's Joker...
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> THE DEAN  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Good morning, I heard you guys getting acquainted with the study groups newest member.
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character">  ANNIE </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Sorry Dean, the position of robot is filled and Abed's much more Iron Giant than this HAL 9000.
</p>
</div>

<div class = "action">Annie looks to Abed for approval of her movie references, Abed gives her a thumbs up.</div>
<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
What's this even for? Is it a punishment?
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> TROY </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Is this your way of telling us Formula One is finally a class at Greendale?
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> THE DEAN  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
No.
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character">  TROY </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Damn...
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> ABED </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Want to turn the study room into a racetrack later?
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> TROY  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Get out of my brain
</p>
</div>

<div class = "action">Troy and Abed do their signature handshake.</div>
<p class = "character"> THE DEAN </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Okay, there are serious students that study right outside this room who have made serious complaints about certain study groups using this space for yelling matches and cat fights.
</p>
</div>
<p class = "character"> BRITTA  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
My apartment was being fumigated, my cats had nowhere else to go!
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> THE DEAN  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
This 'traffic light' is a noise detector. When it's green you can GO ahead and talk. When it's red you need to STOP immediately. Yellow... well you get the point.
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> ANNIE  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
(whispering) And what are the repercussions of it turning red?
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> JEFF  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
The alarm can blare all it wants, they can't prevent us from using a private study room we've rightfully signed out of a public facility. The Dean's bluffing.
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> BRITTA  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Aha! Reverse psychology!
</p>
</div>

<div class = "action">Annie shakes her head at Britta.</div>
<p class = "character"> BRITTA </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Okay... normal forwards psychology then.
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> PIERCE  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
I find this outrageous. If those noise crusaders have such a problem with us why is this the first time we've heard of it?
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> THE DEAN </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
It's not! Do you guys listen to anything I say!?
</p>
</div>

<div class = "action">The Dean raises his voice and causes the traffic light to turn red again. As the alarm blares, the Dean gets flustered and leaves the room from embarrassment.</div>
<p class = "character"> TROY  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
(whispering) He really isn't good at this whole discipline thing.
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> PIERCE </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Why are you still whispering?
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> TROY </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
(whispering) Because I don't want another penalty on my license, I already have way too many unpaid parking tickets.
</p>
</div>

<div class = "action">Opening sequence.</div>
