In this post I take a stab at writing a scene for my favourite TV show, Community. This script is an imagination of the conversation that would have taken place the day after Parasite historically swept the Oscars.

<br>
<div class="script-content">
<div class = "action">  <strong>MONDAY MORNING. THE GREENDALE SEVEN SITS AROUND THE STUDY ROOM TABLE.</strong> </div>

<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p>  
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue"> Good morning! How was everyone's weekend? </p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> ABED  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
I watched The Passion of the Christ. Wasn't a very faithful adaptation of the book.
</p>
</div>

<p class= "character"> TROY  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
I went to a duck pond to feed the ducks... but I ate all the bread before I got there.
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Did anyone else watch Parasite win four Oscars? Big night for Korea.
</p>
</div>

<div class = "action">  Shrugs and silence across the group. </div>

<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY (CONT'D)  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Nobody watched it or nobody's happy for Korea?
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> JEFF  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Shirley, we don't all have enough time to watch four hours of Hollywood jerking itself off. But of course we are happy for <strong>South</strong> Korea.</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> PIERCE  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Speak for yourself Jeffrey.
</p>
</div>

<div class = "action">  Everyone glares at Pierce, except Troy. </div>

<p class = "character"> TROY  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
In Pierce's defense, the Oscars viewership has been dropping recently. Maybe it was time to spice it up.
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> BRITTA  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Troy... Pierce was referring to South Korea.
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> TROY  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Oh... me too...
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
What about you Abed? Surely you watched the Oscars.
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> ABED  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
I'm with Jeff on this one. I don't think their target audience is people who know anything about film. It's more so middle-age divorcees.
</p>
</div>

<div class = "action">  Shirley is visibly upset. Britta feels bad. </div>

<p class = "character"> BRITTA  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
That's not true Abed. I know plenty of people that watched it.
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> JEFF  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Do you know anyone that doesn't go to Greendale?
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> BRITTA  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Shaa... my parents...
</p>
</div>

<div class = "action">  Shirley gets more upset. </div>

<p class = "character"> JEFF  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Okay, at the end of the day, Shirley is allowed to like what she wants. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. I record reruns of Wipe-out, Troy might have a masturbation fixation, and Shirley enjoys the Academy Awards.
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> TROY  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Wait... the Oscars and the Academy Awards are the same thing?
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> PIERCE  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Of course they are dummy. The Academy Awards get rebroadcast as the Oscars for the Mexican audience.
</p>
</div>

<p class = "character"> TROY  </p>
<div class="dialogue-block">
<p class = "dialogue">
Oh no. Does that mean the Tony's were last night as well? I promised an Italian chick I'd watch it with her.
</p>
</div>

<div class = "action">  Opening sequence. </div>
</div>
