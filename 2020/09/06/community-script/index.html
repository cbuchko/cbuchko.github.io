This scene deals with the aftermath of the study group receiving a poor mark on a Spanish paper. I like to call this one "Forgery and Evasive Maneuvers".</div>

<div class = "action"><strong>INT. GREENDALE HALLWAY - DAY</strong></div>
<div class = "action">The study group walks out of Senor Chang's Spanish class. In their hands they each hold a paper that was recently graded.</div>
<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p> 
I got a D? I haven't gotten a mark this bad since Sunday School.
<p class = "character"> PIERCE </p> 
Really? Have you seen that birthmark on your lower back?
<p class = "character"> JEFF </p> 
Don't sweat it Shirley, it's just one bad grade.
<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p> 
Wait a second, my grade is low as well...
<p class = "character"> ABED </p> 
Do you think Chang found out we've been helping each other study?
<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p> 
Abed, that is the entire point of having a study group.
<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p> 
What did everyone else get?
<div class = "action"> Everyones sounds off suspiciously low grades until...</div>
<p class = "character"> TROY </p>
A.
<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p> 
Uh, Troy, did you say Chang gave you an... egg?
<p class = "character"> TROY </p> 
No Shirley, that was the Easter Bunny, and he only comes once a year.
<div class = "action">Abed hangs his head in disappointment.</div>
<p class = "character"> TROY (CONT'D) </p>
I got an A.
<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p> 
How is that possible?
<p class = "character"> BRITTA </p> 
Don't be rude Annie.
<div class = "action">Britta leans closer to Troy.</div>
<p class = "character"> BRITTA (CONT'D) </p> 
If you have an adderall guy and you aren't telling 
me, you are dead to me.
<p class = "character"> TROY </p> 
Kurt Cobain taught me to say no to drugs. I've just been... using my time wisely...
<div class = "action">Jeff snatches the paper out of Troys hands</div>
<p class = "character"> JEFF </p> 
No honest person has ever used that phrase.
<div class = "action">Jeff skims through Troy's paper</div>
<p class = "character"> JEFF (CONT'D) </p> 
Troy, you cited six sources, none of which were Wikipedia, when Chang probably doesn't even know what a reference is. I've never seen you do more than the required work.
<p class = "character"> ABED </p> 
It's true. Last week we went to Build-A-Bear but he left before picking out its outfit.
<p class = "character"> TROY </p> 
Alright, I didn't write it. The school supplies a forgery service to ensure the integrity of our teams.
<br>
(To Abed)
<br>
And I told you Mr. Snuggles felt more comfortable without clothes.
<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p> 
I didn't realize you still played football.
<p class = "character"> TROY </p> 
I actually don't. The Dean said my character has grown past football... and that the team lost its funding.
<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p> 
So what do you play?
<p class = "character"> TROY </p> 
Dodgeball.
<div class = "action">Everyone snickers.</div>
<p class = "character"> PIERCE </p>
Dodgeball, a sport so gay it has ball in its name.
<div class = "action">The group lists off several other sports that end in 'ball'.</div>
<div class = "action">The banter continues.</div>
<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p> 
What were you saying about preserving the integrity of the teams?
<p class = "character"> JEFF </p> 
That integrity was lost a long time ago when Greendale's equality initiative resulted in three water polo drownings.
<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p> 
You'd think after the first one they'd at least give them life jackets.
